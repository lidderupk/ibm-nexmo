# Create a Smartbot agent with Nexmo platform and Watson services

We will be covering the same topic we covered during online meetup the day before in person!

Do You Believe in Magic?

Join IBM Developer and Nexmo for this meetup and learn how to power Watson Assistant with Nexmo voice platform.

You will be introduced to IBM Cloud and Watson Assistant and then we will build a bot that will help us perform magic ! As engineers and technologists, it's easy to dismiss magic as merely a puzzle to solve. But you can perform magic right now using IBM Watson Voice Assistant and Nexmo.

Every great magician needs an assistant. Sometimes, however, relying on another human makes this problematic. But what if you could create a virtual assistant to amuse and amaze your friends? I will show you exactly how using AI technology and a cell phone. This talk will cover ideas on using intents, conversations, and aliases within IBM Watson Voice Assistant to allow any spectator to call your virtual assistant and it will reveal their selected card.

Arthur C. Clarke's 3rd law states "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." So go ahead, pick a card. Your magician's assistant will be waiting.
